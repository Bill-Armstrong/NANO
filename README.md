# NANO NOT WORKING YET!!!

NANO: Noise-Attenuating Neuron Online: real-time machine learning that cares about the noise in data. 

The software here is not finished.  It embodies an new idea for measuring and attenuating the noise in data.  In the noise-attenuating neuron, a function is approximated by affine function pieces ("linear pieces") joined continuously using maximum and minimum functions. If the training error of the linear piece is less than or equal to the noise variance, the piece is not split, giving us a superb way of avoiding over-training. When pieces have stopped splitting, training is finished. This is a new form of stopping rule for neural networks.

In NANO, instead of having a single training set, we attach a training buffer as part of the ALN. The next stage will be putting thousands of NANO's together into a huge interconnected reinforcement learning system to see what happens. Will it ultimately be a general learning system of unimaginable power? So as not to create too much undeserved hype, and at the same time keep the military people from seeking to exploit it, for now we are going to call this final stage "The Electric Chicken".
