# NANO NOT WORKING YET!!!

NANO: Noise-Attenuating Neuron Online: real-time machine learning that cares about the noise in data. 

The software here is not finished.  It embodies a new idea for measuring and attenuating the noise in data.  In the noise-attenuating neuron, a function is approximated by affine function pieces ("linear pieces") joined continuously using maximum and minimum functions. If the training error of the linear piece is less than or equal to the average noise variance over the piece, the piece is not split. This is a superb way of avoiding over-training. When pieces have stopped splitting, training is finished. This is a new form of stopping rule for neural networks far better than the usual one with a validation set.

In NANO, instead of having a single training set, we have a training buffer as part of the ALN. The next stage will be putting thousands of NANO's together into a huge interconnected reinforcement learning system to see what happens. Will it ultimately do nothing useful or be a  general learning system of unimaginable power? So as not to create too much undeserved hype, and at the same time keep the wrong people from seeking to exploit it, for now we are going to call this final stage "The Electric Chicken". Can you imagine any  military AI researcher courageous enough to go to a boss and ask permission to study electric chickens?
