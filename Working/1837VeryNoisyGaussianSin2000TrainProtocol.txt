The task is regression
A DTREE is to be created by training using the data file
Opening data file C:\Users\arms\Documents\GitHub_NANO\NANO\VeryNoisyGaussianSin2000.txt for analysis succeeded!
The line read from the file is: 
 X	NoNoise	Noisy 
The line is assumed to be a header line. Analysis continues.
There were 3 items read in the header line
First data line to help checking for correctness:
0	0	27.03394537
Count of items in first data line = 3
The number of columns in the data file is 3
The number of header rows in the data file is 1
The number of data rows in the data file is 2000
Preprocessing splits data file into TVfile and TSfile (for testing). 
Opening file C:\Users\arms\Documents\GitHub_NANO\NANO\VeryNoisyGaussianSin2000.txt succeeded.
PreprocessedDataFile created with 2000 rows
Warning: if the ideal function to be learned is complicated,
Or if there is a lot of noise in the data, there must be MANY times
more rows in the data file as there are ALN inputs!
The number of rows in the test set is 200
The number of ALNs to be averaged in bagging is 1
The dimension of the problem (inputs + one desired output) is 3
The output variable is __C

************** Analysis of TV file begins ********
Dimension nDim is 3, nRowsTV is 1800
Side of cube per point in the TVset (in stdev units) = 0.081647
Stdev of __A = 288.927578 . Epsilon = 23.590146 
Stdev of __B = 394.298149 . Epsilon = 32.193365 
Stdev of output variable __C = 762.259345 
The Epsilons above are sides of boxes per point in units of the particular input

**************  The problem is to fit samples with a smooth function  *****

 ********* Begin Creation of Noise Variance Tool ********
Setting up the training data in TRfile

**************Approximation with one or more ALNs begins ********
Training approximation ALN with the goal of avoiding overtraining
Jitter is not used during approximation
The smoothing for training approximation is 0.000000
An F test is used to decide whether to split a piece depending on hit count. 
----------  Training approximation ALN ------------------

Iteration 0 of 20 epochs Estimated RMSE 744.403060 Active/Total LFNs 1/1

Training of approximation ALN is complete after iteration 0 
All leaf nodes have stopped changing!

**** Analyzing results of approximation begins ***
Size of datasets PP TV Test 2000  1800  200 
Root mean square error of ALN is 689.149844 
Warning: the above result is optimistic, see results on the test set below
Importance of each input variable:
Abs imp = stdev(input var) * average absolute weight / stdev(output var) 
Abs imp is numerical and indicates ups and downs in output when the given input varies.
For example a sawtooth function with six teeth would have importance 12.
First we have to compute the standard deviation of the output variable.

Standard deviation of the output in the TVfile 762.259345
Variable __A: stdev = 	288.927578; avg.wt = 	-0.714499; abs imp = 	0.270825
Variable __B: stdev = 	394.298149; avg.wt = 	1.004459; abs imp = 	0.519582

***** Constructing an ALN decision tree from the  ALN *****

******** Testing the DTREE on the test set **********
Creating internal data file OutputData succeeded!
It has 200 rows and 4 columns.
The following is based on a test set with 200 samples
Please be careful interpreting the results for small numbers of samples!
RMS deviation of DTREE output from desired
(or from 0 if output column not present) is 701.139261 
Mean absolute deviation of DTREE output from desired is 374.120826
Maximum absolute deviation of DTREE output from desired is 4988.084253

Please examine the output file named:
   1837VeryNoisyGaussianSin2000TrainScatterPlot.txt
The rightmost column of the output file is the ALN prediction.

Please examine the R or E file named:
   1837VeryNoisyGaussianSin2000E.txt
Where possible, missing data file output values have been computed.
The rule at the top shows the input variables and output column used.
Using this file as an input data file, you can do further replacements.
