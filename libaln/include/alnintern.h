// Functions
void splitControl(ALN*, double); // if average noise variance of a piece is higher than the square training error, splitting is prevented
void doSplits(ALN*, ALNNODE*, double); //does the recursion of splitcontrol
void zeroSplitValues(ALN*, ALNNODE*);  // sets the square error to zero in each LFN
void splitUpdateValues(ALN*); // accumulates the training square error and number of hits on each linear piece
void splitNoiseSetVAR(ALN*); // accumulates the variance square error and number of hits on each linear piece
void dodivideTR(ALN*, ALNNODE*); // divides the total square training set errors of the pieces by their hit count
void dodivideVAR(ALN*, ALNNODE*); // divides the sum of noise variance samples of the pieces by their respective hit counts

// Thread procedures
unsigned int ActionsProc(void* pParam);  // separate thread


//Global variables
extern int nNumberLFNs;				// used to control the epoch size, which should be proportional to this
extern BOOL bDecimal;					// Numbers could have a decimal point (as in North America).
extern BOOL bComma;						// Numbers could have a comma (as in Europe).
extern BOOL bStopTraining = FALSE;
extern int nDim;							// Number of ALN inputs plus one for the output.
extern int nOutputIndex;			// Usually nDim - 1. A change of output of an ALN
			// occurs for the inverse ALN when the ALN output is monotonic in an input.
extern long nRowsPP;          // The number of rows in the PreprocessedDataFile
extern long nRowsTV;          // Number of rows in the TVfile (used to create TRfile).
extern double* adblEpsilon;   // An array of doubles holding the average distance between inputs.
extern double* adblMinVar;    // Array of minima of the variables
extern double* adblMaxVar;    // Array of maxima of the variables
extern double* adblStdevVar;  // Standard deviations of the variables
extern double  dblTrainErr;   // Set in cmyaln.h at the end of training
extern double  dblLinRegErr;  // The error of linear regression for use in upper-bounding output tolerance
extern double* adblLRW;				// stores an ALN weight approximation from linear regression
extern double* adblLRC;				// ditto for centroids


// Files
extern FILE *fpData;									// The data file which contains all data.
extern FILE *fpProtocol;							// The file to record the results of the experiment. Rename to save.
			// IMPORTANT: You can open this file several times to see how training is going. 
extern FILE *fpReplacement;						// A file containing replaced missing values.
extern CDataFile UNfile;							// copy of the data file, but with missing values replaced by special number
extern CDataFile PreprocessedDataFile;// The preprocessed file created from the Universal file
extern CDataFile TVfile;							// The file now used for all training sets.
			//The software should be changed to allow any file to be used for training.
