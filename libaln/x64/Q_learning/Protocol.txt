Started program at Mon Oct 21 07:42:23 2019

Time step delta t = 0.01
Three values of torque for control: 0 or + or - 0.03
Initial number of training iterations = 5
Each iteration does 4 epochs of training 
Each epoch has 10000 samples
Creating ALN, four variables, output variable 3 (zero based)... succeeded!
An F-test based on estimated noise variance is used for stopping splitting.
Data about the ALN's data buffer after loading: 
nTRmaxSamples = 10000  
nTRcurrSamples = 10000  
nTRcols  = 9  
nTRinsert = 0 MSE or F -50
Sequence of 5 iterations begins.
MinRMSE = 1e-06 Learning rate = 0.2 Jitter =  0
Iteration 1 of 5 begins.
Iteration 2 of 5 begins.
At the end of this iteration, no more splitting occurred
Iteration 3 of 5 begins.
Iteration 4 of 5 begins.
Iteration 5 of 5 begins.
Sequence of 10 iterations begins.
MinRMSE = 1e-06 Learning rate = 0.2 Jitter =  0
Iteration 1 of 10 begins.
Iteration 2 of 10 begins.
Iteration 3 of 10 begins.
Iteration 4 of 10 begins.
Iteration 5 of 10 begins.
Iteration 6 of 10 begins.
Iteration 7 of 10 begins.
