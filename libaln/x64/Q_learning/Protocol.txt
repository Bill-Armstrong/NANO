Time step delta t = 0.1
Three values of torque for control: 0 or + or - 0.03
Initial number of training iterations = 1000
Each iteration does 1 epochs of training 
Each epoch has 50 samples
Creating ALN, four variables, output variable 3 (zero based)... succeeded!
The mean square error below which splitting stops is 0.1
Data about the ALN's data buffer after loading: 
nTRmaxSamples = 50  
nTRcurrSamples = 50  
nTRcols  = 9  
nTRinsert = 0 MSE or F 0.1
